      <h2><li><b>JoJo's Bizarre Adventure </h2></li></b>
       <img src="joestars.jpg" height="50%">
      <p> Jojo's Bizarre Adventure is a multi-generational tale about the escapades of the Joestar Family, an aristocratic family with English ancestors. It's separated into eight sections, each of which focuses on a different descendent. Each installment introduces a fresh cast of characters and adversaries, as well as a new environment. Each member of the Joestar bloodline has a star shaped birth mark near their shoulder blade. The varying eras and different countries also produce radically different main characters. The first Joestar – Jonathan - is a gentleman and honourable. Joseph Joestar, however, is a lazy trickster and cheat with a heart of gold. Then you have Jotaro who’s a violent delinquent with little to no respect. Jojo is a series that does away with fillers. The series is all about the action and doesn't give a crap about pandering to sex appeal. It’s different from your typical shounen: employing distinct art styles, the most epic game of rock, paper, scissors you’ll ever see and even a wager for your soul over an intense video game; the series has a lot of originality and creativity.
